# LeetCode Solutions

Welcome to my repository of solutions to problems from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com)!

This repository is organized into folders by **algorithms**, **data structures**, and problem categories. Each folder contains my implementations and solutions written in **TypeScript**.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- **Data Structures** - Custom implementations or uses of data structures.
- **Algorithms** - Implementations of popular algorithms.
- **Problems** - Solutions to various LeetCode problems.
